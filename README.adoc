= js-rules

The R2D2 product stack is composed of multiple NodeJS micro-services.
They need to be written with the same rules, and it's a lot of time spent maintaining every config file on all repositories.

== Install

You need to add the following NPM development dependency to the project that needs to be checked:

`npm install --save-dev @r2d2bzh/js-rules`

Once installed, `@r2d2bzh/js-rules` provides the `r2d2bzh-js-rules` executable from the https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/folders#executables[node_modules executables].
You have to call `r2d2bzh-js-rules` from the https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scripts[postinstall script] of the `package.json` file of your project:

[source,json]
----
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "r2d2bzh-js-rules"
  }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
`@r2d2bzh/js-rules` pulls the following dependencies so you don't have to do it yourself:

[source,json]
----
include::./package.json[tag=dependencies]
----
====

== How ?

To do so we are using three tools:

____
What is {prettier-link}[Prettier]?
An opinionated code formatter
____

This tool is responsible for the code format: comma, semicolon, width, that's for `Prettier`.

____
{eslint-link}[Eslint]
Find and fix problems in your JavaScript code
____

A useless variable?
`var`, `const` or `let`?
All these conventions are settled by the `eslint` configuration.

____
{husky-link}[Husky] can prevent a bad git commit, git push and more üê∂ woof!
____

This tool allows us to easily share git hooks.
We are using it with the previous ones to keep our code base safe from linting errors.

=== On save

==== Prettier

When you save your file, you can ask your IDE to format your code for you.
It will follow the rules described in the `.prettierrc.json` config file.

In order to make it work you may need some plugins:

* https://github.com/madskristensen/JavaScriptPrettier[VSCode]
* https://github.com/prettier/vim-prettier[Vim]
* You can find an IDE plugins list on {prettier-link}[Prettier]

==== Eslint

The exact same thing goes for eslint.
You can ask your IDE to follow the rules specified in the https://github.com/r2d2bzh/eslint-config[`eslint-config`] repository.

In order to make it work you may again need some plugins:

* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint[VSCode]
* You can find an IDE plugins list on https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations[eslint documentation]

NOTE: These are not mandatory but strongly recommended.

=== On commit

When you commit your code modifications, the following `husky` hook will be executed:

[source,sh]
----
include::.husky/pre-commit[tag=commands]
----

The hook will simply ensure that the project's source code complies with the `eslint` configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If an error is found during the validation the commit is canceled.
You will have to first fix the lint errors before trying to commit again.
====

=== On push

`js-rules` will also ensure that the following `husky` hook is used on push:

[source,sh]
----
include::.husky/pre-push[tag=commands]
----

So as long as the current branch name of your project does not reflect a work in progress, linting and tests are executed on push.

[NOTE]
====
The convention applied to tell that a branch holds a work in progress is that its name is of the form:

* `wip/other/branch/name/items`
* `.../wip/other/branch/name/items`

`wip` is case-insensitive, `WIP`, `wIp` or any other combination work as well.
